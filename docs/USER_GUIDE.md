## Getting Started

### Installation and Setup

For complete installation instructions, see the **[Installation Guide](INSTALLATION.md)**.

**Quick version**: Load extension in Chrome → Go to Roll20 → Click extension icon → Connect dice.

### First Time Connection

1. **Wake Dice**: Gently roll your Pixels dice to wake them
2. **Click Connect**: Press "Connect to Pixel" in the extension popup
3. **Select Device**: Choose your dice from the Bluetooth device list
4. **Confirm Connection**: You should see connection status in the popup

### Connecting Multiple Dice

The extension supports connecting multiple dice simultaneously:

1. **Connect First Die**: Follow the steps above
2. **Connect Additional Dice**: Click "Connect to Pixel" again
3. **Select Each Die**: Each die will appear as a separate device
4. **Manage Connections**: Each die maintains its own connection status

**Note**: Each die is identified by its unique device ID, so you can connect multiple dice of the same type without conflicts.

## Using the Modifier Box

### Show/Hide the Modifier Box

The modifier box is a floating interface that lets you add modifiers to your dice rolls.

- **Show**: Click "Show Modifier Box" in the extension popup
- **Hide**: Click "Hide Modifier Box" in the extension popup
- **Minimize**: Click the "−" button on the box (temporary hide)

> **Note**: The modifier box can only be completely shown/hidden from the extension popup. The "×" close button has been removed to prevent accidental closing.

### Managing Modifiers

#### Adding Modifiers

1. Click the "Add" button in the modifier box header
2. Edit the modifier name (e.g., "Attack Bonus", "Skill Check")
3. Set the modifier value (-99 to +99)
4. Select the radio button to make it active

#### Editing Modifiers

- **Name**: Click the text field and type a new name
- **Value**: Click the number field and enter a new value
- **Active**: Click the radio button to select which modifier applies

#### Removing Modifiers

- Click the "×" button next to any modifier row to remove it

### Positioning and Sizing

- **Move**: Drag the header to reposition the box
- **Resize**: Drag the resize handle in the bottom-right corner
- **Minimize**: Click "−" to temporarily hide (click again to restore)

## Rolling Dice

### Physical Rolling

Simply roll your connected Pixels dice normally. The extension automatically:

1. Detects the dice face value
2. Applies the selected modifier (if box is visible)
3. Posts the result to Roll20 chat

### Chat Display Modes

The extension automatically adapts the chat display based on modifier box visibility:

#### Modifier Box Visible (Detailed Mode)

When the modifier box is shown, chat messages include full breakdown:

```
[Modifier Name]
Pixel Die: [4]
Modifier: [+2]
Total: [6]
```

#### Modifier Box Hidden (Simple Mode)

When the modifier box is hidden, chat messages show only the result:

```
Result
Pixel Dice: [6]
```

This creates a clean, uncluttered experience when you don't need modifier details.

## Advanced Features

### Multiple Dice Support

- Connect multiple Pixels dice
- Each die maintains independent connection
- All connected dice work simultaneously

### Theme Adaptation

- Interface automatically matches Roll20 theme (light/dark)
- Consistent visual integration with Roll20 UI

### Connection Management

- Extension monitors connection status
- Automatic reconnection attempts
- Connection status visible in popup

## Best Practices

### For Optimal Performance

1. **Keep dice charged**: Low battery affects Bluetooth reliability
2. **Stay close**: Keep dice within Bluetooth range (typically 30 feet)
3. **Wake dice before use**: Roll gently to activate if they've been idle
4. **One connection per device**: Don't connect dice to multiple devices simultaneously

### Display Optimization

- **Detailed When Learning**: Keep box visible when teaching or learning rules
- **Simple When Flowing**: Hide box during fast-paced combat for clean display
- **Minimize for Breaks**: Use minimize instead of hide for temporary pauses

## Additional Information

### Browser Compatibility

- **Supported**: Chrome, Chromium, Edge (Chromium-based)
- **Not Supported**: Safari (due to Bluetooth Web API limitations)
- **Requirements**: Chrome 56+ for Bluetooth Web API support
